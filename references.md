# List of literature I used by now (will be adding more)

1. Auditory Neuroscience : Making Sense of Sound
Jan Schnupp, Israel Nelken, and Andrew J. King
https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/techlib-ebooks/detail.action?docID=3339190&pq-origsite=summon
**Completed chapters 1, 2, 3, 6**

2. Wang, D. L. and Brown, G. J. (Eds.) (2006). Computational auditory scene analysis: Principles,
algorithms and applications.
**Can't find this online on NTK's website - need to ask personally**

3. Computational Models of Auditory Scene Analysis: A Review
Beáta T. Szabó,, Susan L. Denham and István Winkler
https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2016.00524/full

4. Wikipedia - multiple articles - sound recognition, sound processing, Fourier transform,
biological structure of the human ear (multiple articles),
ASA, CASA, signal separation, filters and filter banks, spectrogram, etc.

**What I lack right now is some examples of implementations of CASA systems, overview of
possible algorithms and libraries to use (basically any practical knowledge)**

### Some honorable mentions

 - https://dspace.cvut.cz/handle/10467/69387  **this one is REALLY big for a bachelor's
work, I'm afraid to end up like this**

 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY  **not really sure whether I'll need FFT at all,
will just leave this here for now**
