# Using Computational Auditory Scene Analysis algorithms for Automatic Transcription of Polyphony

1. Study and describe the basics of sound recognition and auditory scene analysis in humans
(keywords: biological structure of the human ear, source separation, cocktail party problem,
auditory scene analysis, pitch perception, physical properties of the sound).
2. Study and describe applications of the computational auditory scene analysis algorithms for
sound recognition and separation.
3. Prepare a dataset that consists of recorded piano streaming sounds for non-simultaneous grouping.
4. Using the prepared dataset, try to apply a selected algorithm for computational auditory
scene analysis to separate "streams" ("auditory objects") from the original sounds.
5. Use the obtained "streams" as inputs for a selected music transcription algorithm.
Combine the received monophonic outputs into a single polyphonic transcription.
6. Analyze the results of the approach to the music transcription described above. Compare
to another approaches.
