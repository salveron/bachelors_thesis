# Using Computational Auditory Scene Analysis algorithms for Separating Monophonic Music from Noise

1. Study and describe the basics of sound recognition and auditory scene analysis in humans
(keywords: biological structure of the human ear, source separation, cocktail party problem,
auditory scene analysis, pitch perception, physical properties of the sound).
2. Study and describe the existing algorithms for computational auditory scene analysis and
their applications for sound recognition and separation.
3. Prepare a dataset that consists of recorded monophonic piano sounds.
4. Using the prepared dataset, try to apply a selected algorithm for computational auditory
scene analysis to separate tones from the noisy background.
5. Analyze the results of the approach to the source separation described above. Experiment with the 
implemented algorithm.
